# Next Feature Ideas

## **Visual Enhancements:**

* slight delay between each dealt card to mimic real dealing speed - make it configurable (eg: 300ms delay between cards default)

## **Proposed Features:**

1. Visual Enancement: Add chip stacks and betting animations to improve user experience. Use the common stacking patters for various bet types - eg: center of the circle for even money bets, horizontal stacks for splits, vertical stacks for double downs, etc.
2. Visual Enhancement: Add visual indicators for the shoe and discard pile to enhance realism. Should be realistic, show where the cut card is, and the discard pile should show an accurate representation of the cards that have been played.
3. Persistent Game State: Implement a feature to save and load game states to the database, allowing players to resume their games later.
4. Multi-Player Support: Introduce a multi-player mode where multiple users can join the same game session and play against the dealer.
   * Chat Functionality: Add a chat feature for players to communicate during multi-player games.
   * Leaderboards: Create leaderboards to track top players based on their winnings over time.
   * Spectator Mode: Allow users to watch ongoing games without participating.

   * Tournaments: Organize regular tournaments with entry fees and prizes to encourage competition among players.
   * Social Media Integration: Allow players to share their game results and achievements on social media platforms.
   * Voice Chat: Integrate voice chat functionality for a more immersive multi-player experience.
   * Use Websockets: For real-time updates and interactions in multi-player mode.
   * Use Redis or similar technology: For managing game state and player sessions in multi-player mode.
   * Use WebAuthn and ToTP: For secure user authentication and account management.
