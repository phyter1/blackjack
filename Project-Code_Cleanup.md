# Project: Code Cleanup

This repository has matured in functionality and is now ready to progress from MVP to Core Code, as such we need to clean up the repository, re-organize, modularize, document, break down monolithic files, and ensure best practices are followed throughout the codebase and consistency is maintained.

## **Cleanup Tasks:**

1. **Remove Dead Code:**
   - Identify and remove any unused or commented-out code segments.
   - Ensure that all imports are necessary and used.
   - Eliminate any redundant functions or variables.
   - Archive or delete any obsolete files that are no longer relevant to the project.
2. **Modularization:**
   - Break down large files into smaller, more manageable modules.
   - Ensure each module has a single responsibility and is easy to understand.
   - Create clear interfaces for modules to interact with each other.
3. **Documentation:**
   - Add comprehensive comments to explain complex logic and functions.
   - Create or update README files for modules to describe their purpose and usage.
   - Document the overall architecture of the project, including data flow and module interactions.
4. **Code Consistency:**
   - Ensure consistent coding styles and conventions across the codebase.
   - Standardize naming conventions for variables, functions, and files.
